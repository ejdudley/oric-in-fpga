## Oric Atmos 48K in FPGA

Oric Atmos 48K implemented in FPGA on a Pipistrello board.. 
This is based from source from http://passionoric.free.fr,  which initially was not working. 
Extensive rewriting of the ULA brought this to life, it is currently working as expected in LORES and HIRES.


## Project History
The project was created on Sep 11, 2013, under svn-based source control.
